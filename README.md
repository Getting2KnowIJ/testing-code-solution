# Final Code for "Create, Run & Debug Tests" Tutorials

This project shows the final code that we step through in the Getting to Know IntelliJ IDEA chapters on testing. We
recommend cloning the starting point of the project at [testing-code](https://github.com/Getting2KnowIJ/testing-code)
and stepping through the tutorials in the book, this will give you the tools you need to understand how to create, run
and debug unit tests in IntelliJ IDEA.

Use this project only if you're stuck, or want to play with the final, functioning code.
